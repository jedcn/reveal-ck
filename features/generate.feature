  In order to easily generate reveal.js presentations
  As a user of reveal-ck
  I want to use the "reveal-ck generate" command

        oh yeah!
    """
    When I run `reveal-ck generate`
    Then the exit status should be 0
    And the output should contain exactly ""
    And the following files should exist:
    | slides/slides.html |
    | slides/index.html  |
