Thanks for thinking about making reveal-ck better!!

Anyone can help-- regardless of whether you're a developer or not.

Please read through the following and let me know if you have any
questions!

## Ways to Help

Please start by understanding the overall goal of reveal-ck:

> reveal-ck exists to make it easy for anyone to create a reasonably
> pretty presentation with a minimal amount of work.

And further, it has several other design ideas:

> reveal-ck aims to reduce a presentation into a single file.

And also,

> If you need more than one file to describe your presentation (say,
> you've got images) then those extra files should be stored in a
> reasonable place.

This means things like images should live in a directory named
`images/` and CSS should live in a directory named `css/`, and more
generally, there shouldn't be any surprises as you flesh out your
presentation.

And:

> The modern day web browser is powerful enough to be your
> presentation run time.

Use fonts, regular images, animation gifs, and colors, and do it
without any extra software on your phone, tablet, or computer. If it's
a modern browser than it should *just work*.

## With that said..
